    "The purpose of the case study is to classify a given silhouette as one of four different types of vehicle, using a set of features extracted from the silhouette. The vehicle may be viewed from one of many different angles.\n",
    "Four &quot;Corgie&quot; model vehicles were used for the experiment: a double decker bus, Cheverolet\n",
    "van, Saab 9000 and an Opel Manta 400 cars. This particular combination of vehicles was chosen with the expectation that the bus, van and either one of the cars would be readily distinguishable, but it would be more difficult to distinguish between the cars.\n",

    "The points distribution for this case is as follows:\n",
    "1. Data pre-processing - Understand the data and treat missing values (Use box plot), outliers (5 points)\n",
    "2. Understanding the attributes - Find relationship between different attributes (Independent variables) and choose carefully which all attributes have to be a part of the analysis and why (5 points)\n",
    "3. Use PCA from scikit learn and elbow plot to find out reduced number of dimension (which covers more than 95% of the variance) - 10 points\n",
    "4. Use Support vector machines and use grid search (try C values - 0.01, 0.05, 0.5, 1 and kernel = linear, rbf) and find out the best hyper parameters and do cross validation to find the accuracy. (10 points)"
